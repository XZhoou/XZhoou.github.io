My research interests include:

- *Economics of Transportation*
- *Pedestrian Dynamics*
- *Travel Demand Management (TDM) strategy*
- *Optimization in Transportation Field*

My current research mainly focuses on modeling and analyzing reservation-based travel demand management (TDM) strategies, incorporating noncompliance behavior, and exploring the resulting new equilibrium states. In addition, I’m also highly interested in incentive and mechanism design for congestion management. I hope to explore more possibilities in this area in my future research.

If you’re also interested in the modeling and analysis of transportation network or TDM , feel free to reach out to me via email!
