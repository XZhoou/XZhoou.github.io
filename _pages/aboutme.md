I was born in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, and I completed my bachelor in Information Management & Information System in 2023 at School of Economics and Management, Beihang University in China.

I love playing football, badminton, and e-sports including *League of Legends* and *CS:GO*.

My girlfriend is Shi-Xin Zhao, who is studying for a master's degree in *University of Electronic Science and Technology of China*.
