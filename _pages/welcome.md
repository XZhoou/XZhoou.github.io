My name is Qi-Hang Sun, and I am a Ph.D. candidate at Beihang University under the supervision of Prof. [Ren-Yong Guo](https://sem.buaa.edu.cn/info/1094/10798.htm). My current research interest include travel demand management, transport network analysis, and optimization problems in transportation field. 

I am about to visit the University of Passau as a guest researcher in the group of Prof. Dr. [Tobias Harks](https://www.fim.uni-passau.de/en/mathopt), from Mar. 2026.

I graduated from Beihang University in 2023 with a Bachelor's degree in Management (*Information Management and Information System*) and a minor Bachelor's degree in Engineering (*Biomedical Engineering*).
